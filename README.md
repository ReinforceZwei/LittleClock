# Important information
This program **contains** bugs that were found but not yet fixed. If you have found any bugs, please **do not** report them. There will be a new rewrite for this program soon (if I have enough motivation to do it), imporving the code quality and reducing bugs.

Any idea of imporving this program are  welcomed.
